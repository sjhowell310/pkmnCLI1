Project written in Python3 to make an accurate Pokemon Generation I battle machine that operates on the command-line.

Thanks to Pokemon Showdown for making their information open-source (i.e. pokedex and movesets, learnset, base stats), they've saved me a LOT of page scrubbing.

More to come as the project develops, so far working on startup functions, instantiating trainers and their parties with command line interfaces.
